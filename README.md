# wmn-simulator
A custom c++ simulator developed to simulate wireless mesh networks. 
Results from the simulator published in 2009 paper "[Fair Scheduling 
with Multiple Gateways in Wireless Mesh Networks](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5076187)".

All of the simulation parameters are set in the Simulation.h file including the number of repeats, the number of mesh routers, the interarrival rate of packets etc.
